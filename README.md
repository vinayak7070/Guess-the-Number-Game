# **Guess The Number**

This is a simple program written in C that allows users to play a guessing game. The user will be prompted to enter a number, and the program will generate a random number between 1 and 100. The user will then have to guess the number, and the program will tell them whether their guess is too high, too low, or correct.

2. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
3. Compile the program by typing "gcc guess.c -o guess" in the terminal.
4. Run the program by typing "./guess" in the terminal.
5. Follow the prompts to play the game.
